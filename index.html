        <h1>World's Suicide Rate Report</h1>
        <p style="color: black;">Every suicide-related death is tragic. Research does indicate, however, that suicide rates can be decreased with more knowledge and assistance.
      <p style="color: black;"> In order to do this, suicide has to be acknowledged as a public health issue and its prevalence needs to be decreased.</p>

        <h2>Visualizations</h2>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: justify;">Estimated annual number of suicides per 100,000 people. Suicide deaths are underreported in many countries due to
social stigma and cultural or legal concerns. This data includes modeling based on global suicide patterns, and includes
adjustments and extrapolations that aim to account for missing data and underreporting.</p>

        <h2>About the Report</h2>
        <p>Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide.</p>
